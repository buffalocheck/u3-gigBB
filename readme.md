* Requirements: *

* Include a screenshot of the site in repo's README *

See: Screen Shot-GigBB.png in the repo:

* Explanations of the technologies used *

This is a straight forward MEAN stack app:
MongoDB: a schemaless NoSQL database system that saves data in JSON (making it easy to pass between client & server).
ExpressJS: a lightweight framework for Node.
AngularJS: JavaScript framework providing 2-way data binding.
Node.js: server side JavaScript execution environment.
Materialize: for styling.

* A couple paragraphs about the general approach you took *

We set out to build a useful app with a scope that allowed us to pair-program the entire site and deliver a "better-than-MVP" result on time so we could all better understand the tech involved. An outline of the major steps includes:

1. Set a theme for the app.
2. Agreeing to focus on MVP and build out to there.
3. Writing user stories and wire-framing the users' site-flow.
4. Work plan: complete the back-end first & then style.
5. Establish what we know & what we do not know.
6. Setting a daily schedule: regular breaks from screens.
6. Meeting over the holiday weekend to complete the project.

Understanding the "who, what, why" of the site's "big picture" allowed us to see "how" it would happen. Item #5 speaks to the level of commitment to finish and work well together.

* Descriptions of any unsolved problems or major hurdles your team had to overcome *

We used the Recipes app as a starting point and decided to replace Bootstrap with Materialize. This was tedious but worth the effort as we better understand it and were able to realize our plans.
